*  @file: maxNonConsecutiveSumFromTwoArray.cpp
*  @author: Avinash Yadav
*  @brief: We are given ‘2’ arrays . Select some elements from both of these arrays (select a subset) such that:-
            1. Sum of those elements is maximum(Sum of the subset is maximum).
            2. No 2 elements in the subset should be consecutive.
            (Note: If you select, say the 5th element from Array-1,
            then you are not allowed to select 4th element from either Array-1 or Array-2 nor are you allowed to select the 5th element from Array 2
            all of them are considered consecutive)
                        Example:
                        Array 1 : {1, 5, 3, 21234}
                        Array 2 : {-4509, 200, 3, 40}
                        Answer: 200 + 21234 = 21434
