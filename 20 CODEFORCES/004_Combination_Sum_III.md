Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:
- Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
- Each number is used **at most once.**

Return *a list of all possible valid combinations.* 
The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

### Example 1:

```
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]

Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.
```


### Example 2:
```
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]

Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.
```


### Solution:

```cpp
